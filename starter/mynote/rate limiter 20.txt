///////////
rate limiter is to prevent two type :
  -danger denial of service attack(dos) : keep sending to the server till break down and the app become unavailable
  -brutel force attack :trying  million and million of password to guess the right one

*)how works the rate limiter : counting the request comming from one ip address if there are many request block these request

==>use a global middleware
//in globle middleware in the app file
install express-rate-limit :package from npm
require and use the rateLimit function and pass an object of  option
in this object specify the max,the windowMs,message(if depasse the max the the defined interval)

exemple :
//define the rate limit funciton that recieve an object  of option
//specify how many request per ip in certain amount of time
//max request from the same ip is 100 in 1 hour in ms
//the max must adapt on the app
const limiter  = rateLimit({
  max : 100,
  windowMs :1* 60 * 60 * 1000,
  message  : 'too many request from this IP , please try again in an hour'
})
app.use('/api',limiter)

//if you depass the max of request=>the request will be blocked and return
return the message that you defined in the object ,satuscode :429 :too many request
